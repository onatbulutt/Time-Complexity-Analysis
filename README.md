# Opening the Project
1. Download project as zip.
2. Extract the zip.
3. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
4. From the menu bar, select "File" > "Open".
5. Navigate to your project directory and select Time_Complexity_Analysis.
6. Click on the "Open" button to load the project into IntelliJ IDEA.

# Usage
1. Right-click on the file named text in the unzipped file and select copy as path.
2. Paste the selected path inside the quotation marks into the method called hash.ReadFileandGenerateHash on the 4th line in the main class of the project you have opened.
3. After pasting, arrange it so that there are only quotes on the right and left.
4. click on the RUN button located at the top right corner of the Main class inside the project, or press Shift+F10.
5. Observe the consol. 

With the methods in the 6th and 7th lines of the main class, a text file showing the frequency of the words in the text can be created. You can enter the path to the file to be created as a parameter.
Additionally, you can observe the efficiency of the hash table created by entering different table sizes into the hash.ReadFileandGenerateHash method on the 4th line of the Main class.
You can put the piece of text you want to observe in the text file.
